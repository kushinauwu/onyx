rtCamp Hiring Assignment (WordPress Engineer - Simple Theme Challenge)

A WordPress landing page created according to the guidelines mentioned by [rtCamp](https://github.com/rtCamp/hiring-assignments/tree/master/WordPress-Engineer)

This website uses Bootstrap for CSS. I have attempted to recreate the same PSD in WordPress as was given in the hiring assignment.
The site is responsive, and media queries have been used for that purpose.

I have used Theme Check plugin to test whether the site adheres to WordPress guidelines. The [WordPress Theme Unit Test](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) has been imported into this theme.
Configured on [scrutinizer.ci](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/kushinauwu/onyx/)

**Resources used:**
* [Bootstrap 4.3.1](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Images from [Pexels](https://pexels.com)
* [Bootstrap navwalker](https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker)
